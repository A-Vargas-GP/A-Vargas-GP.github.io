# About Me
Hello there!

My name is Amy, and I am a programmer, designer, and 3D modeler seeking opportunities to utilize my multidisciplinary skill set. I recently graduated with a B.A. in Interactive Multimedia, and I have two minors in Computer Science and Music Technology. My skills include software and game development, 3D modeling, graphic design, video editing, and photo restoration/retouching.

I have experience with various programming languages like C#, Javascript, PostgreSQL, Kotlin, and more. I am also proficient in Adobe Suite programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, InDesign, and XD. I have also worked with applications like Unity, Android Studio, Autodesk Maya, Git/Github, and ZBrush. In addition, I was a Learning Assistant where I helped teach classes in game development at The College of New Jersey.
