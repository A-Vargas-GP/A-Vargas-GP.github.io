# About Me
Hello there!

My name is Amy, and I am a programmer, designer, and 3D modeler seeking opportunities to utilize my multidisciplinary skill set.

I will be graduating with a B.A. in Interactive Multimedia with a focus in Animation and Design from The College of New Jersey. I will also be obtaining minors in Computer Science and Music Technology.

My skills include 3D modeling, software and game development, video editing, photo restoration/retouching, and graphic design.

I am heavily interested in the field of animation, but I am open to other fields such as graphic design, VR/AR design, video editing, and photo restoration/retouching.
